# -Final-Assessment
Welcome to my final assessment repository! This project showcases my skills in both Java programming and web development, featuring algorithms and a visually appealing webpage.

## 🌟 Project Highlights

```diff
+ Armstrong Number Checker (Java)
+ Linear Search Algorithm (Java)
+ Neon-Themed Interactive Webpage (HTML/CSS)
```

## 📁 Project Structure
### Java Programs

ArmstrongNumber.java
```diff
        Checks if a number is an Armstrong number (sum of cubes of its digits equals the number itself)

        Example: 153 is an Armstrong number (1³ + 5³ + 3³ = 153)
```
  ArmstrongNumber.java
```diff 
        Implements the linear search algorithm to find an element in an array

        Returns the index if found, or -1 if not found
```
### Web Development

  final.html
```diff
        A modern neon-themed landing page with:

            Dynamic header animation

            Responsive background image

            Clean, centered layout

            External link to Google
```

#### 🚀 How to Run

Java Programs
```diff
bash

javac ArmstrongNumber.java
java ArmstrongNumber

javac LinearSearch.java
java LinearSearch
```
Web Page

Simply open final.html in any modern web browser!
### 🎨 Design Philosophy

### 🔮 Future Enhancements

    Add JavaScript interactivity to the webpage

    Implement GUI versions of the Java programs

    Create a unified theme across all components

### 📝 Final Thoughts

This project represents my journey in mastering fundamental algorithms while developing an eye for modern web design. The combination of technical problem-solving and creative presentation showcases my versatility as a developer.
